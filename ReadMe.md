##  Overview
**StudentSphere** is a desktop application that serves as a *faculty knowledgebase for student information*.  
It allows university faculty to create, edit, search, and manage detailed student profiles, including academic standing, technical skills, professional roles, and faculty evaluations.  
The goal is to give professors an organized, searchable way to track student growth and provide informed recommendation letters, mentorship, and career guidance.

This project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern and demonstrates core OOD principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, modularity, and reusability.  
All data is stored locally using flat-file (CSV) storage as specified in the technical spec.

| **Jeremy Greatorex** | Created define student page, created student class, created student catalog, handled student object to csv conversion. |
| **Samriddhi Matharu** |  Implemented the ViewStudentsPage feature, which displays all saved student profiles in a JavaFX TableView. Integrated it into the navigation flow by connecting the Generate Report button to this new page and verified data loading from the CSV file (including entires with null programming langauges and databases); Also ensured it was sorted in alphabetical order of Students name                                                                                                                      |
| **Ivan Rivera** | Implemented auto refresh capability for generate report functionality                                                  |
